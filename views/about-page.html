        <p>Zeal & Ardor is the one-man brainchild of Manuel Gagneux, 
        a Swiss-American formerly based in New York City. 
        His approach draws on an alternate history and stems 
        from two thoughts: Christianity was imposed upon American 
        slaves, just as it was imposed in Norway, and black metal in 
        the 90's grew as a rebellion to monotheism. What would have 
        happened if American slaves had rebelled in the same way? Or 
        put bluntly: What would satanic spirituals sound like? First 
        album 'Devil Is Fine' was released globally in February 2017, 
        the latest album, 'Stranger Fruit', was released to critical 
        acclaim in June 2018.</p>
